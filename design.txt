game = player
	game.inventory
	game.location

	game.go(direction)
	game.take(item)
	game.drop(item)
	game.look()

locations maintain their state
	location.name
	location.inventory

	location.release(item)
	location.gain(item)
	location.describe()

objects also have state
	object.name
	object.hidden?

	object.describe()

	object.poke() = object.be_acted_on(None)

	object.act_on(object) eg. key.apply_to(lock)
	object.be_acted_on(object) lock.be_act_on(key)

doors can be locked -- conditions?
